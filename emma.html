            <p>
                Long before we launched the beta version of xxxx in 2019, our dream has been to build a reliable xxxxx
                not only for you but with you and everyone who trusts us to look after their xxxxxxxxx.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the almost two years that we've been around, our journey has remained collaborative and we've
                deliberately carried you along as we learned by experience what it means to run a xxxxxx that works for
                people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through numerous notifications(some of which may have annoyed you), impromptu downtimes and support that
                could be a lot faster, you've stuck around and believed in us.
            </p>

                Thank you,<br>
                Team Ate.
